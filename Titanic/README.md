# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

A quick neural network I built to go through the Kaggle competition pipeline.

Data is cleaned (drop irrelevant features, transform categorical into numerical, etc.) and prepared for input to the Neural Network.
Neural Network consists of 6 layers of size decreasing from 512 -> 1. Dropout was used for regularization.
